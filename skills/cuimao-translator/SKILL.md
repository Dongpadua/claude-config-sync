# PDF Book Translator (English → Chinese)

Three-mode translation skill for turning English PDF books into natural, fluent Chinese. The core commitment is **sentence-by-sentence fidelity** — every sentence in the original must exist in the translation, with no meaning added or lost — while reading as if written by a skilled Chinese author.

## Modes

Choose the right depth for the task:

| Mode | Trigger | Steps | Best for |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Quick** 速译 | "快翻", "quick", "速译" | Read → Translate | Quick look, short standalone pieces, checking what a passage says |
| **Normal** 标准 | default, "翻译", "汉化" | Analyze → Translate | Most book chapters, blog posts, general content |
| **Refined** 精翻 | "精翻", "refined", "精细翻译" | Analyze → Draft → Review → Revise → Polish | Publication-quality output, key chapters, final delivery |

### Auto-detection
- "快翻", "quick", "直接翻译", "快速翻译", "速译" → **Quick**
- "精翻", "refined", "精细翻译", "出版级", "深度翻译", "精译" → **Refined**
- Everything else → **Normal** (default)

### Mode upgrade
After Normal mode completes, ask:
> 翻译已保存。如需进一步审校润色，回复 **"继续润色"** 或 **"refine"**。

If user agrees, proceed with Review → Revise → Polish (same as Refined mode Steps 4-6) on the existing output.

## Style Presets

Control the voice and tone of the Chinese output:

| Style | When to use | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `literal` 逐句忠实 | Technical manuals, legal docs, when precision is paramount | Closest to English sentence structure, minimal restructuring |
| `storytelling` 叙事流畅 | Novels, memoirs, narrative non-fiction | Smooth transitions, vivid phrasing, natural Chinese rhythm |
| `elegant` 文采典雅 | Literary fiction, poetry, refined essays | Polished prose, four-character phrases, rhythmic beauty |
| `academic` 学术严谨 | Scholarly works, textbooks, research | Formal register, precise terminology, citation-aware |
| `conversational` 口语自然 | Dialogue-heavy books, informal memoirs, self-help | Casual, approachable, as if speaking to the reader |

If no style is specified, detect from the book's content and tone. For most books, `storytelling` is a safe default. `literal` is recommended for technical reference material.

## Core Translation Philosophy

### 信 Faithfulness — The anchor
- Every English sentence must have a corresponding Chinese sentence
- Facts, numbers, logic, and proper names must match exactly
- Never summarize, skip, or embellish
- Every paragraph break, emphasis, and structural choice from the original must be preserved

### 达 Fluency — The craft  
- The Chinese must read naturally, **not like translated text**
- Reorder clauses into natural Chinese topic-comment structure
- Drop unnecessary English connectives (and, but, that, which)
- Break long English sentences into natural Chinese breath groups (意群), 7-15 characters each
- Use proper Chinese rhythm: alternate long and short sentences
- **Active voice over passive**: Chinese uses 被 far less than English uses passive. Prefer 由/受/让 or restructure into topic-comment
- **Verb complements over adverbs**: "walked slowly" → "走得很慢", not "慢慢地走"

### 雅 Cultural Adaptation — The art
- When English idioms, slang, cultural references, or metaphors cannot be directly translated, find Chinese equivalents that convey the same meaning and emotional impact
- Think about what a Chinese reader would understand, not what the English words literally say
- For cultural references unknown to Chinese readers, add brief inline explanation: **（译注：...）**
- For puns/wordplay that cannot be translated, translate the meaning and note the wordplay in translator's note

## Native Chinese Quality Checklist

After translating, especially in Normal and Refined modes, self-review for these common "translation-ese" problems:

### Europeanized Chinese (欧化中文) — The 6 Red Flags

1. **过度使用"被"字句**: "He was praised" → "他受到了表扬" (not "他被表扬了")
2. **不必要的连接词堆砌**: "因为...所以...", "虽然...但是...", "当...的时候" — Chinese often omits these when context is clear
3. **定语堆叠过长**: English long pre-modifiers → Split into multiple short clauses in Chinese
4. **"之一"泛滥**: "one of the most..." → "极其..." / "...得很", not always "...之一"
5. **"的"字密度过高**: If three or more 的 appear in one sentence, restructure
6. **名词化泛滥**: "the implementation of..." → "实施..." (verb), not "...的实施" (noun phrase)

### Rhythm & Breath

- Read the Chinese aloud in your mind. Does it breathe naturally?
- Alternate sentence lengths. Three long sentences in a row → break one up
- Use four-character phrases (四字格) sparingly for rhythm, not ornamentation
- Chinese prose values 留白 (suggested space) — don't over-explain what the original leaves implied

## Output Format

Chinese-only translation. Do NOT include the English original. The reader wants a clean Chinese reading experience.

### Full book structure

```
# [Book Title] — 中文翻译

## 翻译说明
- 原文：[Book Title] by [Author]
- 翻译方式：逐句翻译（[模式]模式，[风格]风格）
- 翻译原则：信（忠实原文）、达（中文流畅）、雅（文化适配）

---

## Chapter N: [Chapter Title]

### [Section heading if any]

中文翻译段落内容。

中文翻译段落内容。

---

*— 第 N 章完 —*
```

- Preserve all chapter and section structure from the original PDF
- Skip PDF page numbers and running headers
- Output Chinese only, no English original
- Add `---` between chapters, `*— 第 N 章完 —*` at chapter end

## Workflow

### Step 0: Choose Mode & Style

If the user hasn't specified, auto-detect from their phrasing. For books, Normal mode is the default starting point. If the user's quality expectation is unclear, ask briefly: "用标准模式还是精翻模式？精翻模式会逐章审校润色，质量更高但耗时更长。"

### Step 1: Pre-Translation Analysis

**Quick mode**: Skip analysis, translate directly.

**Normal & Refined modes**: Before translating, do a lightweight content analysis. Save as `[book-title]-analysis.md`:

```
## 内容概要
- 主题领域、核心论点
- 作者背景和写作立场
- 目标读者

## 术语提取
| 英文 | 中文 | 备注 |
|------|------|------|
| term | 翻译 | context |

## 语气与风格
- 正式/口语化？幽默/严肃？
- 叙事视角（第一人称/第三人称/全知？）
- 建议的翻译风格：[style preset]

## 翻译难点预警
- [具体段落/表达] → 难点类型（隐喻/文化梗/长难句/双关）→ 建议处理方式
```

For books, this analysis is done once for the entire book (scan first 10-20 pages + table of contents). The analysis informs all subsequent chunk translations, ensuring consistency.

### Step 2: Read & Translate

**Quick mode**: Read PDF pages → Translate directly → Write to `[filename]-chinese.md`.

**Normal mode**: Read chunk → Translate paragraph-by-paragraph, informed by analysis → Append to output.

**Refined mode**: Full five-step pipeline per chapter (see Refined Workflow below).

### Step 3: Chunking Strategy for Books

Books are translated chapter by chapter, with chapters further split if they exceed ~3000 English words.

For each chunk:
1. Read the PDF pages using the Read tool
2. Translate paragraph by paragraph, applying:
   - The terminology table from Step 1 analysis (be consistent across all chunks)
   - The chosen style preset
   - All translation principles from this skill
3. Self-check: Did every English sentence get translated? Does the Chinese read naturally?
4. Write to the output file (Write for first chunk, Edit to append subsequent chunks)
5. Report progress: "已翻译 第N章 (Px-Py)，共约 Z 页"

**Terminology consistency across chunks**: Before translating each new chunk, review the terminology table from the analysis. When encountering a term already in the table, use the established translation. When encountering a new term, add it to the table.

### Resuming interrupted work
1. Read the existing output file and analysis file to find where translation stopped
2. Check which pages/chapters remain
3. Continue from the next un-translated page

## Refined Mode: Full Five-Step Pipeline

For publication-quality output. Each step reads the previous step's output and builds on it. All intermediate files are saved.

### Step R1: Analyze (same as Step 1 above)
Save to `[book-title]-analysis.md`

### Step R2: Draft
Translate the full chapter, applying analysis findings. Save to `[chapter]-draft.md`. This is the raw translation — it will be refined.

### Step R3: Critical Review
Review the draft against the original. **Diagnosis only — no rewriting yet.** Save to `[chapter]-critique.md`:

```
## 准确性
- [问题]: [位置] — [描述：增译/漏译/误译/术语不一致]

## 中文自然度（欧化中文检查）
- [问题]: [原译] → [建议改法]

## 文化适配
- [术语/隐喻]: [当前译法] → [建议调整及理由]

## 总结
[共发现 X 处准确性问题，Y 处表达问题]
```

Key review lens — flag any sentence that reads as "translated" rather than "written":
- Unnatural word order that mirrors English
- Stiff phrasing that a native Chinese writer would never produce
- Overuse of 被/的/之一/当...时/如果...那么
- Metaphors translated literally that sound foreign in Chinese
- Emotional tone flattened or shifted

### Step R4: Revise
Apply all findings from the critique. Save to `[chapter]-revision.md`. Fix all accuracy issues, rewrite unnatural expressions, adjust notes, improve flow.

### Step R5: Polish
Final pass for publication quality:
- Read the entire translation as a standalone piece — does it flow as native content?
- Smooth remaining rough transitions
- Ensure consistent narrative voice and style throughout
- Final terminology consistency check
- Save final to `[chapter]-chinese.md`

## Handling Special Content

### Images & diagrams in PDF
- Note them in place: `[图片：描述]`
- After translation, if the PDF contains text-heavy images (diagrams, charts, screenshots), remind the user: "文中插图可能仍含英文原文，需要手动本地化。"
- Do not attempt to translate image text unless the user specifically asks

### Footnotes & endnotes
- Translate footnote text but keep footnote numbers
- Preserve footnote placement (page bottom or chapter end)

### Code, formulas, technical notation
- Keep exactly as-is — no translation

### Tables
- Translate cell by cell
- Preserve table structure exactly

### Dialogue
- Use 「」 quotation marks for dialogue in Chinese (consistent throughout)
- Add speech rhythm particles: 啊, 吧, 呢, 嘛 where natural
- Preserve character voice: a professor and a teenager must sound different in Chinese

## Configuration (EXTEND.md)

Optional. Create `.pdf-translator/EXTEND.md` in the project root to set persistent preferences:

```yaml
target_language: zh-CN
default_mode: normal        # quick | normal | refined
style: storytelling         # literal | storytelling | elegant | academic | conversational
audience: general           # general | technical | academic | young-readers
chunk_max_words: 3000

glossary:
  "term": "翻译"
  "another term": "另一个翻译"

glossary_files:
  - custom-glossary.md
```

If EXTEND.md is not found, ask once and save. If found, use it. If the user wants to change mid-session, they can just say so.

## Example

### Input (English PDF paragraph):

> The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him. He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky.

### Output (storytelling style):

老头儿教过那孩子打鱼，孩子也爱他。他是个独自在湾流里的一只小船上打鱼的老头儿，他如今已经接连八十四天一条鱼也没打着了。头四十天里，有个孩子跟他在一起。可是过了四十天一条鱼都没打到，孩子爹妈就跟他说，这老头儿如今是彻底"倒了血霉"（salao），意思就是倒霉到了极点。
